## Calculus helper for the polynomial assignment

A polynomial is an expression containing two or more algebraic terms.  In this
assignment, the polynomial is comprised of a variable `x` raised to a power
multiplied by a coefficient.

For example, in the polynomial:

    3 + x + 4x^2

    the first term is  3      (coefficient = 3, power of x is 0, so 3 * x^0 = 3)
    the second term is x      (coefficient = 1, power of x is 1, so 1 * x^1 = x)
    the third term is  4x^2   (coefficient = 4, power of x is 2, so 4 * x^2 = 4x^2)

In the last part of the assignment, you will be asked to differentiate and integrate
the polynomial (using calculus).

The polynomial defines the values a function can take.

### Derivative

A derivative defines the rate of change of the values in the function.  [Here is a 7 minute video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-differentiation-1-new/ab-2-1/v/derivative-as-a-concept)
on Khan Academy describing the concept.

The derivate of a polynomial is the sum of the derivate of each of its terms.  Algorithmically,
you can determine it like this:

Taking the derivative of the polynomial above using this algorithm:

    1st term:  3       1st term derivative: 0 (derivative of a constant with respect to x is 0)
    2nd term:  x       2nd term derivative: 1 * 1 * x^(1-1) = 1 * x^0 = 1 * 1 = 1
    3rd term:  4x^2    3rd term derivative: 4 * 2 * x^(2-1) = 8 * x^1 = 8x

    the derivate of 3 + x + 4x^2 with respect to x is 1 + 8x

### Integral

An integral is the sum of the values of the function. [Here is a 5 minute video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-integration-new/ab-6-1/v/introduction-to-integral-calculus)
on Khan Academy descibing the concept.

The indefinite integral of a polynomial is the sum of the integrals of each of its terms.
Algorithmically, you can determine it like this:

Taking the indefinite integral of the example polynomial using this algorithm:

    1st term: 3        1st term integral  = 3 / (0+1) * x^(0+1)  =  3 * x^1 + C1 (C1 is a constant)
    2nd term: x        2nd term integral  = 1 / (1+1) * x^(1+1) = 1/2 * x^2 + C2 (C2 is a constant)
    3rd term: 4x^2     3rd term integral  = 4 / (1+2) * x^(2+1) = 4/3 * x^3 + C3 (C3 is a constant)

    the integral of 3 + x + 4x^2 with respect to x is C + 3x + (1/2)x^2 + (4/3)x^3 
    (it's convention to add the constants together, so C1 + C2 + C3 = C)

If you take the integral of a derivate of a polynomial, you should get the original polynomial except
for the constant:

    original polynomial: 3 + x + 4x^2
    its derivative:          1 + 8x

    integral of derivative
    1st term: 1         1st term integral: 1 / (0+1) * x^(0+1) = 1 * x = x + C1
    2nd term: 8x        2nd term integral: 8 / (1+1) * x^(1+1) = 4 * x^2 = 4x^2 + C2

    the integral of the derivative is : C + x + 4x^2 
    this is almost the original polynomial - it just differs by a constant.

For these to match exactly you would need to use definite integrals with limits to the
integration (not key to this assignment).
