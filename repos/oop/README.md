# OOP

Object Oriented programming is a common design pattern in modern computer languages.  In Python 
classes are used to define objects, so it's important that you understand class syntax
and how to create (instantiate) objects using your class definitions.

Your [assignment](./assignment.md) is to create a polynomial class so that you 
can make polynomial objects and perform operations on them.  Do the assignment as a pair.

## Standards
<ol>
<li>Given the code for a Python class, instantiate a Python object and call its methods and attributes.</li>
<li>Write Python code for a simple class.</li>
<li>Use "magic" methods to extend your class' functionality.</li>
<li>Design a program or algorithm in object oriented fashion.</li>
<li>Compare and contrast functional and object oriented programming.</li>
</ol>
