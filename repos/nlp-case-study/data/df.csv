It traveled from west to east over Walnut Creek where it appeared to land on the trail.  It definitely went below the tree line.This was near Brentwood Christian School on North Lamar.The craft was about 150m from my apartment, approximately 100 feet in the air and looked like it could have had a diameter of maybe 50 feet, but I didn't see the top of it clearly.It was shaped like an upside-down saucer and it had a clearly metallic surface, like brushed aluminum.  It wasn't wobbling or tumbling or anything like that, just a very smooth controlled descent.I heard no sound at all.  I would not have noticed this object if I hadn't already been looking directly at the sky.Choosing to remain anonymous unless other people come forward with having seen something.((NUFORC Note:  We would like to communicate with this witness, and we would like to have the witness contact the local news media, in order to encourage other witnesses to come forward.

It seemed very low like small plane or helicopter height, but was brighter than anything I have seen before.  It almost immediately began moving rapidly in a straight northeast direction, never diminishing in size or brightness but with a bright orange ""tail"" trailing it and passing directly over my house.  It seemed to be decending, dropping out of view over the roof but was gone by the time I ran to the other side of the house."

(The before situation) This is when I first snuck outside to go stargazing for a while. When I first came outside I began to watch the stars and relax as the last day of school for me is the 5th of May 2017. I see the usual things such as a few shooting stars, twinkling of the stars, and just normal stuff one would see in the night sky. Minutes pass by as my friend and I were talking about the what Earth would look like from space.11:34 p.m CST.(The Sighting itself) Now at this time I was just glancing around in the sky when I first saw it and pointed it out to my friend. It looked like a meteor at first from a very far distance. This was in the East/South sky, about 75-80 degrees. It was such a bright flash of light compared to other stars and it didn't just go away. For a minute I thought it was just another planet. Then thoughts crossed my mind if it was a man made satellite. It couldn’t have been however. It was moving different directions. First traveling towards the South sky. Then it began crossing in a back and forth motion. It would occasionally stop for a minute or two. Then it would go back up and move in this back and forth motion.At this point I stood up knowing it was not man made, as my friend tracked it, I ran quickly grabbed my high powered laser pointer (10 Mile radius Class 4 green colored) my friend pointed it out and we shone it to see if there would be reaction from it. It did seem to react which was very interesting meaning it must have spotted this light, at least a very low power of it. As soon as i shone at this light, it stopped and stood still. It didn't move for at least 5 minutes. It moved again and I shone at it again. The craft stopped again. By this point my friend and I ran inside and changed and began looking up who records these sightings.11:48 p.m CST.  (The call in)  After seeing this I began looking for somebody who would take in this sighting.  I googled exactly where to report and immediately called the hotline.11:50 p.m CST.I told the man at first how i swear it was not a prank call.  I forgot his name (I asked at the end and completely forgot) I explained it as “A fireball"" looking thing that switched directions in the sky”  It was in more words but if I were not so panicky of giving a 15 second detail it would've sounded better.  He told me to make a report on what me and my friend saw and in a way he could describe it.  Therefore, I made this report in order to show that a sighting is just a matter of paying attention.12:09 a.m CST.I began writing the report and finally finished at 12:30 a.m . Thank you for taking note of my findings."

I decided to look up and nothing, then decided to lean forward and look up and saw a ufo above my car with red, blue, green and white lights (bright in nature).  After looking up at it, it moved to my left above tree line, parallel to me at same speed as I was going.  At that time I opened my window and there was no noise from craft.  The road curved, it followed a straight line and I lost sight of it."
6,5/4/2017 23:00,5/5/2017 11:42:29 AM 11:42,5/6/2017,"Lawrence, KS","helicopter chasing orange light at low altitudeI was in my room in my apartment watching Dave Chappelle on Netflix, when I heard a helicopter overhead.  It sounded very low and powerful, so I figured it had to be military, and I-being a total nerd-had to run out to the parking lot to get a look.By the time I was out my door and in the parking lot, I had just enough time to watch a small orange ball of light being chased by what I assume to be a Blackhawk helicopter (because of size and sound) disappear behind the rooftops of the buildings east of me.    This struck me as bizarre because I saw something similar some months ago in the same general area (skies south of Lawrence, I live on the south side of town, not far from Baker Wetlands).  The light was small and orange in color and was about 50-100 yards ahead of the helicopter.  It made no erratic movements but was travelling at a fair clip as the helicopter was tracking it at almost the exact speed and it was moving pretty quickly.  As such, I have my doubts that this could've been a paper lantern (though the color and intensity of the light were similar to one) and the distance ahead of the helicopter rules out a refueling boom.  I'd give the altitude of the two objects to be between 500-1000 ft agl and the speed! of both to be about 100 kts at the time I saw them.Also of note, I saw another object in the sky in the general area at the same time, though it may not have been connected.  This object seemed to be an aircraft judging by the red and white lights it had on it, but it hovered in place for a moment until the lights slowly faded out with no apparent change in location.  The direction I was looking toward would be about a straight line to KCI, so I wasn't immediately suspicious, but--having seen plenty of air traffic heading to and from KCI on that flight path--this didn't look like anything I'd seen before (no landing lights).  I mention this because it was odd and because the previous sighting of a few months earlier of the same kind of event had 2 helicopters chasing the light instead of just one.  Maybe this was the second."

Small about the size of a pin point.  I thought it was a commercial plan but then it moved fast and then just stopped in the sky.  I saw the other end of it and it was fire orange like some type of vent.  It at times moved in the direction the vent was pointing.  Oposite of what normal craft do.  This object moved so smoothly across the sky at fast speeds, slowing down, stopping, changing direction and angle effortlessly.  It was taller from top to bottom than it was wide, no wings.  The best was to describe is it was like a fly just smoothly making all the changes in flight pattern.  I saw a commercial air craft in between me and it and could judge distances from sizes of plane and it.  Hair stood up on my neck and I was very scared for the first min when I realized this is not normal and nothing I have ever seen before.  And then a peaceful calm came over me and I just took in what I was seeing for next 30 sec.  I did not have my phone on me and did not want to leave to go get it.  For a second, I looked next to me to see if anyone else saw I looked back and it was completely gone except for some shiny particles specs of light that disappeared also in a second.  Amazing....!!!!!!!"

It was 87 degrees and uncomfortably humid.  I had been watching the sky for lightning on my way to the doc.As I was coming out of the parking lot, a huge raindrop hit my windshield.  It was so big I tried to get a picture of it with my phone.  I glanced up in the sky to see if there was a big storm coming.  I saw an odd circular area in the fluffy clouds in a clearing.  I saw only a circular swish of a white cloud and nothing else but blue sky behind it.  I always call those ""sucker holes"" for pilots, but this one had a swirly cloud inside it.It wasn't until I was in bed that night looking at my photos to see if I captured tge big raindrop on my windshield.  My daughter was in Hawaii and I was going to show her she was missing giant rain here at home in the Portland area, and a stormy muggy day.When I looked at my photo, the raindrop is there, but much to my surprise, so is somethibg odd in with the swirly swish cloud!  It looks to me like the shape of the Trent UFO in McMinnville, and this is not far from that area mileage-wise.I thought maybe it was a dirty spot on my window, but my window is clean and I can clearly see this object is blurry like it is moving fast.  There is even some light reflecting on the left side of it in the photo like it is reflecting off an object.   I have no clue what appeared in my photo, but here it is!"

This was not an aircraft and it was not a Chinese lantern…  There was no flicker of fire or blinking lights.  I estimate it was less than a quarter mile above me, and maybe the size of a yoga ball.

I was watching the NBA playoffs spurs vs raptors and I just returned from grabbing a drink and my favorite cigar.  It just so happened I caught it in plain eye sight and was able to zoom in on this object to record it and the way the lights go from left to right as ordered one red light three or four white lights then one red light and reversed!   There's been times a big spot light would appear then a steady two orange lights before take off!  But only one orbital aircraft was there tonight instead of two at least this is what I thought!  Then here comes this blue spinning object you couldn't see in plan eye sight!  I looked away from my camera phone twice and couldn't believe I couldn't see it but I seen it on my phone!  As I turned after a couple minutes to show I was literally outside my apartment and returned back to where I was standing prior it was gone!  I even thought Venus was the North Star that night haha!  But I screenshot both objects and the blue circular one thrice to show it was moving one has no stars that I could verify the second if you look closely when it was by what I call big o’s belt! The brightest light is was I normally said but in the video I have its clear to see they are planes! This light go so bright it lit up blue!

They have a video.Standing facing south in front of their home, approximately 200 ft from highway at 12:13--shortly after midnight, a strange steady orange light was observed south south west approximately a mile from home.  It was a clear night, no clouds were observed and very quiet.  No traffic passing on road and no wildlife sound.  The witness observed the light for about 5 minutes.  The light appeared to hover over buildings located in that area.  It appeared to be un-moving.  In the video, the light appeared to be a large object.  How large was difficult to ascertain.  The light can be seen above the tree line and was a steady non-blinking light.  At one point, the witness pointed a high powered blinking flashlight in the direction of the object due being unsure what the light was.  The witness was able to see some reflection of a dark shape around the light.  Right after shining the flashlight at the object, all electricity went out in the neighborhood.  This scared the witness who ran inside the home to check on the people inside.  All were ok.  The electricity came back on, so the witness went back outside and noted that the strange light was gone and an alarm was sounding from the building the light had been hovering over.  At this point, the sounds of wildlife returned...frogs, circadas, and coyotes.  Approximately an hour later, the witness noted the same orange light North of him and much further away.  The light appeared to be moving slowly away from the witness's location and then disappeared.  The witness spoke to the people who worked in the building the next morning to see if maybe there was a break-in the night before.  They agreed that the alarm had gone off, but there was no sign of a break-in.  Also spoke to a neighbor who also noted the electricity had gone off for a few seconds the night before."

I didn't think much of it since it was in a high flight path for airlines.  In between the light flashes, the object didn't move much more the a passenger plane would have moved, it flashed one more time and I never saw any lights again, it just disappeared.  I noticed there were no other navigation lights.  No red or green nor a flashing white. this flight path was west to east and would have to be 10 to 30 thousand feet.  No contrail was observed.  No sound heard.I would describe the light as very bright like a helicopter landing light.  The light was to my south and between 75 to 80 degrees, almost overhead.Within about 1 minute there was a plane making an east to west pass almost on a reciprocal course and altitude, all lights were visible, you could hear it, there was no comparison between the two.I spent 2 years active duty in the navy.

He was turned slightly toward me, when this occurred, but he is colorblind, so he saw the brightness of the flash but not the brilliance.  It was as if a straight beam of brilliant blue light flashed in from the window in a horizontal line in front of him, 2 feet above the counter, from the window towards the fridge.  It was so bright, I was unable to regain vision for a second after it happened.  I could swear that I heard a grinding noise in my ears when it flashed, but that may have been from shock.  It was not one consistent color blue, there were shades in it, and it had some orange tinges at parts.  It was the most beautiful light i have ever seen but if i didn't know any better, I would swear that for that few seconds, a seam in the universe ripped. I have had two other sightings earlier this year that were the same, but different from this one.  I am at work, but will try to report them later.  I do not know if what I saw was UFO related.  But it is not my first encounter that I have said.. and I trust my instinct.  We searched the yard.  Checked the stove and all the lightbulbs that were on.  It was not electrical.  There was nothing in the yard signifying anything else."

I assumed it was a satellite, or maybe the international space station, because it was reflecting light.  I pointed it out to my friend and then he told me there was another one coming towards it.  When they started heading towards each other very quickly he even exclaimed ""oh my god they're going to hit each other.""  The two bright star-like objects then spread apart many miles and stopped moving.  They were motionless for another five minutes, or so, but slowly getting dimmer and dimmer, until we could not differentiate them from the blue sky.

I got off the highway at the Peter’s Creek Exit (east side of highway closest to the mountains).  There is a parking lot with a large rock painted to look like a lady bug.  I saw what looked like a low flying plane, with a flight path headed west over the parking lot from the mountains. I pulled into the parking lot to look up and get a closer look of this “plane”. As I pulled to a stop, the object slowed to a stop in front of me and vertically descended to about 100 ft. Its shape was rectangular with four red blinking lights at the corners of its shape.  I remember saying out loud, “Oh my God, this isn’t a plane!”  After that, a white light in the middle of the object started to light up, and I started to get freaked out. I put my transmission into gear and spun around and left the parking lot quickly. It changed direction and starting following me north.  I started screaming because I was scared.  Whatever it was, was going to try and take me.  It was keeping pace with me and flying directly above me so I increased my speed.  It followed me from the parking lot by the highway exit to my street which is about almost one mile to my street.  I turned north from the side road from the parking lot to head towards my street and it was still following me.  I turned east down another street and then north again to head down my street.  As I approached my house I pressed the garage door opener, I slowed to a stop and started to back into my driveway.  As I was backing into my garage, I lost visual of the object.  For a while after that I was scared because I was thinking “oh no!  They know where I live!”"

I saw a bright yellowish round to oval shaped light in the sky right above the tree line.  It was surprising to see because a line of thunderstorms had moved through earlier and it was still very cloudy with light rain.  It was motionless.  It was bright enough to cast light out from around it as the moon does.  The weather was windy and the trees were blowing obscuring my vision somewhat.   My first thought was that it actually was the moon, but then I realized it was far too low for the moon at this time of night; also, I went back in the house to tell others (about 2 minutes), and when I returned, it had moved to below and behind the tree line.  It seemed that it had moved down in a “setting” pattern as the sun does.  I could still see bits of it through the trees because it was so bright.  I went back into the house to report what was happening.  When I came back, it was gone completely.((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time indicated by the source, in order to reflect a nighttime sighting.

My wife suddenly told me to pull over on the road because there were two objects in the sky in the proximity of a waxing crescent moon phase.  I have seen UFO objects twice in my lifetime before this at least 40 plus years ago.  We both looked at the objects while we were facing the west.  The two objects appeared to be larger than a planet, saucer/bell shapes in the sky, both were bright with an amber to white hue cast sort of pulsing as they stood at rest in the sky.  I had hoped that they would continue to get closer coming eastward to get a better look at them, but after about a minute, the one on the right began to slowly vanish followed by the one on the left then slowly vanishing.  There was a slight overcast with very high altitude cloud cover with some clearing.  When the objects vanished out of sight, it appeared as though they exited our atmosphere very quickly ! almost straight up and out.  Back in the early 1970's when i saw my first UFO, it occured in broad daylight, and actually had time to get my telescope out (50X) and sight in on it, before it quickly raced across the sky many times the speed of a modern military jet aircraft, and vanished as well.  I understand from my reading that the USA government does in fact have secret propulsion technology at Area #51 and has had it for years, continuing to unveil this high technology into military uses today.  I would not be surprised that the two UFO's we sighted on 4/29/2017 were engineered by our own government.  It is very exciting to see these objects, because it doesn't happen but once or so in a lifetime.  This is my third sighting in 43 years.  Now i must look at the skies every night.  My cell phone camera is too cheap, it would not have showed up well, but to be honest i just wanted to see these UFO's with my eyes.  My wife was a witness to this sighting as well, but she really did not want to take the time to write her own version of the sighting.  It was quick,,,about a minute.

The formation of lights, no more than 200ft off the ground, silently passed overhead moving Northeast. Importantly, the lights seemed to deliberately dip and bob without breaking formation, suggesting they are indeed units comprising a larger array.The formation moved over Water St until it was visible over the Rowe Laboratory.  Interestingly, while moving, the lights adjacent to the trailing terminal lights on either end of the “V” gracefully switched positions.  The formation stopped after this and faded out of sight.  It is worth mentioning that our line of sight with the formation was never interrupted, and we did not observe it flying away: we observed it until it simply faded from view above the Rowe Laboratory.We, the two observers, are developmental biologists who traveled to Woods Hole to attend a regional conference."

Talking about random stuff video games, etc..  He was like hey look at that, I'm like what ... look right there he pointed out a weird flashing object kind of strobish and similar to a plane flash but much brighter.  I said that's a plane he said no look how it's moving.  From where we were sitting he had a telephone pole to our right on an angle so we eyed it up with the pole to see which way it's moving if it even is moving and sure enough a couple of seconds after we did that it started moving.In between the bright flashes, within a mili second of each one, we saw it in one spot then wam it was at least 1,000 yards (from our eyes, could be miles in the sky) but away from its original position.  We had a hard time keeping up with it in between flashes and moving irradic from left to right up And down.  Nothing that a plane helicopter or drone in today's world that's known to the public can move with such speed and agility.  Literally between its flashes, which was absolutely in under a second, it was in a totally different spot far away from the last position.  We watched do this for at least 15-20 minutes moving around.  Then it started moving a little farther away from us south east direction but still very visible with the flashes so bright.  But now it would flash then go dark completely no lights and show up in a totally different spot then it was like before.  We knew by then it wasn't a normal  plane especially because there are a bunch of planes flying in the sky and you see their regular flashes .So we were asking ourselves how do these planes not see see this and move out the way or change course, but the way this thing was moving, it couldn't be near them at the speed in which it moved.  Then, after a minute or so of it going dark, a flashing, then dark again, moving to different spots.  It started flashing and rising up and just hovered while flashing.  Then lit up solid blue or white kind of like a floodlight, but nothing projecting down like you see with other common flood lights or search lights on commercial equipment, it just lit up whatever this thing was.  And for the way it reflected off the object it had to be a light colored object (white light with grey object projects a blueish color).It was fully lit up for about a good 25 seconds went completely dark again then within a mili second we saw the flash of it farther away from where it was lit up which is farther away from where we were.  So more south central south east .  The only thing out that way that it could be as high as it was a project that bright of a light is fort dix combined base  no other airports or private places for such a thing in that direction then fort dix joint base. And in that direction depending on which part of the base is a given 30 to 80 miles away from us.  So that thing was bright .After it headed farther away and disappeared me and my friend went to go get food took about 10 minutes or a little over got back to his house sat on the porch ate an we were still talking about it we never seen anything like it definitely unexplainable when all of sudden we saw it again back in the same area where it was before moving all over and flashing but did not light up solid or hover.  Just kept flashing then went dark and it was gone.  We sat outside for another 20 minutes looking at the sky, never saw it again or anything like it, just saw your normal plane passing by .It was truly amazing how it moved liked that in a blink of an eye.  A night to remember never saw anything like this here before hopefully someone else saw this too and didn't blow it off as a plane it was anything, but I know the area very well and seen everything from regular helicopters to police helis, blackhawks  An your military crafts fly by all the time with lights on and off day and night  just as common as your regular plane and you can hear these far away aswell as a very lit up landscape from homes ect so to be that bright to outshine everything else wow .  . This thing had no sound and moved like no other craft known to the public could truly remarkable experience I will never forget.((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous; provides no contact information.

I immediately called to my nephew to come see as the object cruzed past the house heeding northwest.  There is a military base near to my house, (Andrews Airforce Base).   As the object flew near that direction, the orange light went out and we could still see the the silliwet of the object which was now black without distinct form at the distance.  The object made no sound as it cruised by and eventually faded from sight.  My nephew thinks it was some new military technology.  I believe it was not of this world.

My 6 year old daughter said, “Daddy, what are those flashing lights in the sky?”  I was travelling in the southwest direction and I looked up to my left and I noticed several (approximatley 6) flashing lights up in the sky that appeared to flashing and what I would describe as dancing in the sky.  At first I wasn't sure what to make of them.  I thought they were some sort of flares or even military aircraft doing some sort of exercise.  But since I live in the Okanagan valley and there is no Air Force bases in the area, I knew they were not any of conventional military aircraft.  The objects that I was observing were absolutely silent.  Given the way these object were moving in the sky, I then realized that what I was witnessing was not a normal or easily explainable occurrence and was most likely Extra-terrestrial in nature.I quickly pulled off to the side of the road and grabbed my phoned\, got out of my vehicle to start video recording the lights.  That's when I noticed a second group of (approximatley 4 or 5) that suddenly appeared below the first group.  They looked like they were flying closer to Okanogan Lake, before the flew upward to join the first group.  The two groups formed two separate formations and proceeded to fly eastward towards Kelowna.  I had my camera zoomed in and locked on both groups and continued to record them as they were flying away.  Or so I thought.  After approximately 20-30 seconds of “recording”, I realized that I didn’t actually hit the record button on my phone.  I quickly hit the record button and was able to zoom in on the luminous objects as they were flying away.  I was able to record the lights, (which were flying in two groups, one approximately 6, the other approximately 4) for about 30 seconds until they essentially were out of sight.Important points:  although it was early evening and the sun was starting to set, there was still plenty of daylight outside.  These objects were extremely bright in sky the objects appeared to be well below the clouds when I first noticed them as well as below the tops of the mountains.  The second group of lights appeared to be flying lower in the valley near the lake although it did not occur to me at first but what I witnessed I would describe as orange glowing orbs, since I did not observe any sort of metallic craft with any visible lines.  Only lights."

We saw a low hovering (what we assumed was a plane at first) aircraft in the sky in front of us/in the direction we were heading but to the right (South of us).  It did not seem to be moving at first.  It had three lights on the underneath: two were a greenish tint and one was more of a regular white/yellow color turning on and off at random times slowly.  The one turning on and off seemed to move around like it was on a rotator.  All of the sudden, after we both acknowledged we saw it and started questioning what it was, it started to move East over the road very very slowly.  I had my window down and it made only a quiet sound. Then, on the tip of the 'wings' two more lights lit up (two on each end).  They were brighter than the three lights in the underneath middle of the craft.  We thought it was a very large drone after trying to rationalize.  It was a long skinny rectangle shape, but I saw no blades or anything.  If it was, it was a drone that was 15-20 feet or more. It was terrifying and my fiancé and I are very logical.  We asked the Indian man who picked us up in a golf cart to take us from the parking lot to the front if he knew of any drones the Indians had, and he acted concerned and said he did not.  He said the head Indians may have something like that for protection, but I honestly thought it had to be military.  Honestly, it looked like a multimillion dollar military aircraft with incredible mind blowing technology.  I was stunned and can not stop thinking about it!  I could not even get myself to take my eyes off it long enough to grab my phone in fear it would disappear.  People around us were slowing down to see it as well.((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report provides no contact information.  PD))"

Part 2: Still wondering what we had just seen go down by Hinkson Creek, but driven by the need for ice cream, we continued to Andy’s and queued up at the drive-up window.  It had only been about 5 minutes since the first observation.  I was looking west; the sun was setting, when I saw a quickly moving object traveling from the northwest to the southeast.  It appeared silverish and spherical.  It was either quite high or very small.  Then I saw another object which seemed to be trying to overtake the first one, and another one and another one, 6 in all, following the first one.  Of course my first thought was helicopters but we did not hear any kind of mechanical sound.  It finally occurred to me to use my cell phone and try to get a picture.  All I got was small dots, but they are there.  The time was 8:07.  Interestingly a helicopter did fly over to Boone Hospital and it was easily seen and heard of course! it was landing.As an addendum to this report, a friend, who lives in Salem, Missouri, “was entering Columbia on 63 Hwy and saw a white glowing object between 500 and 1000 feet in altitude going over the Femme Bonne Creek.

My husband, who was driving, and I, were traveling east on East Broadway.  We were between Broadway Bluffs and Trimble when I noticed something very low in the sky in front of the car.  It appeared pale blue in color, almost sky color, about the size of a pea at arm’s length, maybe slightly larger.  It was on the passenger side of the car, so I had a good view of it, it seemed to be spherical.  I did not see any appendages, it appeared very smooth.  We stopped at the light at Trimble to make a left turn which gave me time to watch it.  (My husband watched in the rearview mirror.  He confirms my observations.)  At this point I’m thinking it must be a balloon.  It stayed at about the same height and distance from the road as it flew west over Green Valley Drive.  It was approaching a tall stand of trees at Hinkson Creek when it paused in midair and rapidly descended diagonally out of sight.  Ok, not a balloon.  Maybe it was a drone?  About 35 minutes later we went to the area where we had seen it go down; very secluded for being in a city.  Hinkson Creek is at the end of Green Valley Drive, which turns south and becomes Moon Valley Road.  Open fields and trees."

Not perfectly round though if that makes sense.  Because of its side to side movements and being stationary for minutes, I that it might be a helicopter.  I was in the Army and was Air-Assault, so I have sling loaded and have ridden in many helicopters, so I soon realized that's not what it was.  It was about 6000 feet in the air at first and it took off over our home and slowed to almost a full stop.  It was higher in elevation as it went above my home but you could see the outline.  It was kinda round and you could see a light around it coming from the inside.  Like a revolving lit restaurant looking from outside of it.  It actually started scaring me when I realized it had no sound coming from it.  It moved slow but then quickly.  Faster than a plane can fly.  The lights were a smoky white light coming from inside.

The cloud was slowly moving west to east.  Many cloud-to-cloud lightning bolts were flashing within the cloud, but few cloud to ground bolts were visible.  The lightning bolts were blue-violet in color.  Many low rumblings were coming from the cloud, but few could be connected to a single lightning bolt.  A person watching the cloud with me commented that the lightning activity was both unusually quiet and concentrated within the cloud.  They stopped watching the cloud and went inside before the object became visible.  They also noted that their dogs, normally afraid of lightning, were unusually calm during the storm.I decided to videotape the electrical activity visible in the center of the cloud a few minutes.  After recording the central portion of the cloud, I thought it might be a good idea to record the rear.  The sighting occured during the following seconds.During a fraction of a second a lightning bolt lit up the rear of the cloud.  When it did, what appeared to be the corner profile of a building-sized rectangle appeared.  A second brighter flash illuminated a wider area, revealing more of the object.  The object then disappeared from view.  Between the two flashes, the object appeared to change shape.I recorded more video of the cloud hoping to see the object again, but failed to get any more footage.  Other clouds similar to the first passed by to the south.  Two planes flew in a line southward over the area about 5 to 15 minutes afterwards.A person I know in the area claims that a wifi dongle had to be reset due to activity that night, and/but I can't tell if the object was the cause.I was told that two weather radars were down for maintenance during this time.I have sent screenshots from the video to the email address below, but they aren't very detailed.

I told her to be quiet, but she just kept on meowing, so I opened my eyes. I looked out of my window to see what the cat was meowing at thinking it must be a box elder bug on the glass or something, but instead I saw a big green oval of light.I live in a high rise building and can see Council Crest and the eastern side of West Hills from my apartment.  I can make out the houses and features of this part of West Hills well.  I could see a big green oval of light in the sky.  It seemed to be moving slower than a plane or helicopter, and seemed to be silent.  I put on my glasses so I could see it better out of curiosity and when I realized it wasn’t a plane or helicopter, I ran out of bed over to the window to get a better look. I saw the oval move towards West Hills.  Then it slowly went over the hill and then I couldn’t see it anymore.  The whole time it was floating around, it was gradually changing color from green to orange-red and back to green, with the color change seemingly starting towards the bottom right of the oval, and then sweeping over the rest of the oval until the thing had mostly turned orange-red.I don't know if the oval was solid or just light, but it seemed to have very clearly defined edges.  It was not like spot lights at all, which kind of have fuzzy, soft edges.I know the oval was not a plane because planes are not oval shaped and they move faster.  I see planes all the time from my windows, sometimes even antique ones, but this was not plane shaped and did not make any sound like a plane.  I know the green oval was not a helicopter because I see helicopters a lot, too, and they are noisy and I can clearly make out the helicopter shape.  In fact, I saw a helicopter come from the SW part of Portland towards the center of Portland a few minutes after I saw the green oval. I know this wasn’t a car on the streets of West Hills because I could clearly see the oval in the middle of the sky at first.  And I don’t think it was a drone because it looked to be wider than the houses it was above in West Hills when it was above them.  I thought for a second that it might be the aerial tram, which I can see a little bit from my place, but the aerial tram doesn’t change colors, it is not green and it doesn’t float around in the middle of the sky, obviously.  I don’t even think that tram runs at 12:30AM.I know the oval wasn’t making noise because I can clearly hear planes and helicopters from my apartment.  Also, even though this green oval floated really close to the houses on West Hills, nobody’s lights went on like they heard a loud noise above their house.  I had my window cracked and could hear the helicopter a few minutes later, so I know that the noise would have definitely have come through if there were any.I tried to take a picture of the oval but my hands were shaking and I kept dropping my phone because I was a little nervous about the green thing in the sky, not knowing what is was and all, and I was trying to make my cat stop meowing by petting her at the same time.  By the time I got my phone camera ready, the thing had floated over the West Hills and out of my sight.  I don’t know what the green oval thing was, so I am hoping maybe someone else does and can tell me.  I could draw a picture of it if that would help identify it."

89,1/9/2017 03:12,4/29/2017 4:49:55 PM 16:49,5/6/2017,"Birmingham, AL","I heard a low humming sound.About 3 am, I was up watching tv, when I felt a low humming in the air.  It had a wide range of volume so I knew it couldn't be in the house because of the brick structure I was in.  I walked outside as the humming got stronger, looked up and saw nothing but complete darkness which was normal but the humming was right above me and moving.  Then about thirty seconds later, I noticed the black sky I thought I was seeing was moving cause now I can see the back of it moving away making view of the real night sky with stars and night light.  The black object slowly moved on over my back yard which is three acres but the object was at least one mile long and one mile wide cause of the duration of time it took to become noticed by sound and the time it took to disappear.  It was about a quarter mile above my trees.  The sound was a air humming sound with no detonation."

I happened to be the only person on the street at that time.  I saw a light in the night sky in a Northern direction towards the Hollywood Hills.  I first I taught it was a LAPD police helicopter.  However, when I stopped and look saw it was two orange balls in the night sky.At first I thought they were moving.  However, then I realized they were stationary.  They just stood in the sky not moving.  I was alone on my street and couldn't figure out  to do.  Then I said to myself let me take a picture of the objects.  Before I could get my phone out to take a picture one ball disappeared leaving a shining orange sparkling light, then completely disappeared.  A few seconds later the second one disappeared exactly the same way."
91,10/14/2016 00:00,4/30/2017 12:32:06 AM 00:32,5/6/2017,"Smithtown, NY","Strange orange lights moving parallel in the sky.I was talking to my friend before she was leaving my house one night, and I remember, looking up at the night sky.  There were quite a number of stars out, as I live in the woods, so it was always nice to gaze up at them.  Then from the corner of my eye, I saw something orange. Looking over, I noticed lights in the sky, moving at the same speed and parallel with each other.Upon seeing them, it turned out there were two more sets of lights.  One of the sets of lights, reminded me of a colon symbol from the keyboard, moving straight over my house and over the trees.  Following the same path was another set of lights only the looked as if a colon was on it's side.The third set of lights, broke the formation by going diagonally across the sky.  It seemed to have started off with them but ended up breaking away, still staying parallel with itself.  It was almost as if the sets of lights were attached in the pairs by a bar.These lights didn't blink, and they weren't slow like a plane. They also seemed to be flying too low for them to be a plane as well. I'm pretty sure they were actually in the atmosphere.As I watched them, I had three thoughts cross my mind.  One was just surprise, but the other two thoughts stood out.  These thoughts were ""get inside"" and ""what are you looking for?"".  Of course, I had stayed rooted to the spot until they were out of site, before my friend and I said goodbye.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))"

We noticed the light was to large and to be a star and kept growing in size and intensify.  We also noticed the object was moving towards the freeway.  The light on this object stated to fickler as it moved over I-5.  The large light then went out and we both got very quiet as we could see a triangle shaped craft with three small lights on it.  As we continued down I-5, we drove right under it and through the sun roof on my highlander I could see two small windows on the side of the vehicle.  The object was black and hard to see.  I have seen strange objects in the sky in this area before.  The entire area between Woodburn and Salem is very deserted."
93,10/1/2015 22:00,5/5/2017 3:31:17 PM 15:31,5/6/2017,"Rogers, MN","2 yellow orange objects moved past my windows.I was in bed watching tv and saw a light out of the corner of my eyes, moving past my bedroom window.  I thought it was one of those things you light a candle and it floats away.  I jumped out of bed to run to patio door in living room to go on to deck to watch it go by.  As I got to door, I saw another one coming right behind it.  They both moved at the same pace very slow.  At that moment, I knew it was not what I thought it was.  I moved into the dark as I did not want them to see me.  At that same moment it was like the 2nd one told the first one to turn and they both turned and moved over the cornfield towards the grade school.  I heard a plane above and looked up and then looked back and they were gone.  They glowed yellow orange and did not make a sound.  I was about 15 feet from them as they passed by. I am not sure of date as I really blew it off as luminaries (think that is what they are called). Until I saw quite a few being sent off on tv and these did not move like them.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Hello Mr. Davenport,  thank you for getting back to me so soon.  I know it was in 2015.  Not sure if it was spring or fall. I just remember there was not any crops in the field behind my town home. It was warm out as I had some windows and patio door open.  Now that I really realize what I saw, I am going through the same emotions again as I did that night.  But now I am having a lot of anxiety.  When they passed, I did not feel evil, it was like they where looking in the windows on the 2nd level.  I tried to tell myself that they where what every those luminary things are with the candle that makes them float away.  Until I saw them being set off on TV.  They floated up, these objects moved steady across and changed direction.  I told myself that they had to be tied together by a long string if they were luminaries.  There was no sound at all. I hope this helps.  I would like to know if any other sightings in my area and if possible to reach out to them.Thank you for your time.

95,10/20/2013 02:00,5/1/2017 4:43:35 PM 16:43,5/6/2017,"Brockville (Canada), ON","Brown saucer with red and green lights seen in Brockville, Ontario, Canada.Though I do not recall the exact date, it was roughly 2013-2014, and I believe it was late in the year (around September).  I was in bed and I saw the UFO through my window.  It was, judging by the distance, a seemingly very small craft.  Perhaps the size of a Dodge caravan, maybe bigger.It had metal prongs/legs all around the craft, red and green lights, and the vessel itself was brown in colour with darker brown, thick plates on what seemed to be the front of the vessel (based on the plates facing the direction it was moving).  I opened my window to see if I could hear anything, but I could not.  The UFO was literally, completely silent.  It was not emitting any sort of fog or exhaust, simply hovering as if it were completely defying gravity.The UFO was also extremely slow-moving, moving at ~5 mph.  It moved across the sky in a straight line and then stopped abruptly, perfectly frozen in place, for about 60 seconds before continuing its path.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

97,3/14/2003 17:00,4/30/2017 11:25:54 AM 11:25,5/6/2017,"Navarre, FL",i was observing what I thought to be a large electrical pole floating with the current of the sound.  Pole passed me a few hundred yards out.  When the pole was approximately 100 yds past me it stared going upstream.  I ran inside to get field glasses.  The pole stared an angle toward me.  My first observation was that it was rotating very fast.  The next thing I noticed was beyond my comprehension.  The best I can describe is to be compared to a candy stripe.  The stripe on the pole was not moving and i compare to a belt of water (irredesent).  The pole lifted with waves then i saw what ill call wings vibrating fast.  The wings looked like they were made of water. the wing were attached to the stripe.  I called for my wife to examine.  The rain blocked my vision.  I put this out of my mind never mentioned.  I saw them on the history channel 2012.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))
98,6/1/1997 16:00,5/1/2017 8:03:55 AM 08:03,5/6/2017,"Boston, MA","TR3B Absolutely Certain!I saw the TR3B in the sky in Massachusetts in 1997.  It hovered for 15 minutes, then accelerated from 0 to like MACH 10 in a fraction of a second.  It is real!  A US Navy recon space ship that defied the laws of inertia right in front of me!  I was driving on the highway and saw the triangular shaped craft in the sky.  I pulled over into the breakdown lane and stared at it.  I could see 3 bright lights at each corner of the craft.  It twisted clockwise and counterclockwise like it was floating and was light as a feather.  After 15 mins, it took off at an incredible speed.  I was 100% confused by this when it happened and for years didn't tell anyone for fear of being ridiculed.  And now 20 years later thanks to YouTube.  I now know I'm not crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!((NUFORC Note:  Many people seem to believe in the existence of a craft called the TR3B, but no photos have been forthcoming, as far as we know, over the course of the past several decades.  If such a craft exists, we have to wonder why it would be being flown over Boston, MA.  PD))"
