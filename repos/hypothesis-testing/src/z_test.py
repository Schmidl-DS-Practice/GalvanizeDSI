    Parameters
    ----------
    ctr_old: float
      The click through rate in the pre-treatment sample.
    ctr_new: float
      The click through rate in the post-treatment sample.
    nobs_old: int
      The number of observations in the pre-treatment sample.
    nobs_new: int
      The number of observations in the post-treatment sample.
    effect_size: float
      The size of the difference between pre-treatment CTR and post-treatment
      CTR to test for.
    alpha: float (between zero and one)
      The p-value threshold to use for rejection of the null hypothesis.

    Returns
    -------
    z_score: float
      The computed z-score for the test of proportions.
    p_value: float
      The computed p-value for the test of proportions,
    reject: bool
      Is the null hypothesis rejected at the given threshold.
