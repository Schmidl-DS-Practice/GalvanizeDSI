#  Get up and running for the DSI on the command line. 

Data scientists are often asked to work in a Unix/Linux command line environment.  We'd like to get you comfortable working in it.
As a DSI student, you get $1000 credit on Amazon Web Services so that you can log-in to Linux servers and have them do your 
computational bidding.  The first part of the assignment guides you through the sign-up process.

##  A little background on today's topics

Unix -- and by extension OS/X from the terminal -- provides the best platform for doing science because it is robust and has many simple simple commands which can easily be combined to solve whatever problems you encounter.  Furthermore, scientific clusters and cloud computing such as [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) (AWS) almost always runs some flavor of Linux.  Learning Unix will considerably boost your productivity because it will help you wrangle data and quickly answer questions about files, data, and more.

For Unix, one of Sobell's Linux books is a great references, such as [A Practical Guide to Linux Commands, Editors, and Shell Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Guide-Commands-Editors-Programming-ebook/dp/B009AVGJLO/ref=la_B000APJW04_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1444934667&sr=1-4&refinements=p_82%3AB000APJW04) because it covers all the basics as well as shell programming and editors
