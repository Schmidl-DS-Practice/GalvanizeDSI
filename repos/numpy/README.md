# NumPy
NumPy is an extremely useful library for doing mathematics in python.  It is very fast due to the fact that it leverages C code to do computationally-intensive operations.   It has built-in libraries for doing many linear algebra opperations.

## Goals
<ol>
<li>Understand the difference between an array (size = (n,)) and a matrix (size = (n,m))</li>
<li>Understand how numpy slicing opperations work</li>
<li>Use numpy to perform linear algebra opperations like matrix multiplication</li>
</ol>
