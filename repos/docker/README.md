# Docker
Docker is an [open-source](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce) application that performs operating-system level [containerization.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization)  These containers can hold multiple independently running applications within a single (usually Linux) instance without the overhead of running multiple virtual machines.  

For developers, Docker provides a means for making an environment where an application runs the same way, all the time, regardless of host operating system.

Before doing the assignment, follow the guides linked in `make_containers_for_course.md` to make docker containers that will be used later in the course.  

The assignment (`assignment.md`) asks the student to work through two tutorials in [Docker for Beginners](https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/beginner/readme.md) in [Docker Labs](https://github.com/docker/labs).
