# Feature Branch Workflow Exercises

When making branches, we recommend that each group member simply names their
branch after themselves, e.g. `terri`, `john`, `manuel`.  It will be easy to
identify the branches on Github this way.

Though any group member could merge their branch into `master`, at this time
we recommend that **only one group member is responsible for the merging**.
It will ensure that the merges happen sequentially and in a controlled manner.
Also, merge the branches one-at-a-time!

Exercises:
1. Everyone adds a file   
   Right now, there's only one file in the `src` directory called `main.py`. 
   The purpose of this exercise is for each group member to add a file to
   the `src` directory, and at the end for all team members to have access
   to all those files on their respective branches.  

   The content of the file doesn't matter (suggest using .txt files, just
   make sure that each group member uses a different name for the .txt file).
   Follow the **For group case studies** section in the [Git_reference_guide.pdf][1].  
   
   The goal for this exercise is for everyone to have all group members' files on 
   their `master` branch and then to branch off to continue their development 
   using their own branch.  

2. Everyone adds their own modification to one file.  
   In `src/main.py` there is room for each team member to add their own simple function.
   The content of this function doesn't matter (it could simply print your name), but make
   sure the function names from each group member differs. Follow the same workfow used above
   to do this.  

   The goal of this exercise is for everyone to have a `main.py` file at the end that
   includes everyone's function on their `master` branch, and then to branch off to
   continue their development on that file in their own branch.
