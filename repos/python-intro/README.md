This is the DSI's Python Introduction.  The assignment has the following
objectives associated with Python:
* Create a simple application executable from the Terminal.
* Choose the appropriate data structure (list, dictionary, or set) for the task at hand.
* Read and write files.
* Properly import functions from a helper script into a main script.
* Demonstrate the usefulness of the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
* Use the standard library debugger (pdb) to debug Python code as it executes.
* Use the `ArgumentParser` to pass arguments to a script at execution.

The assignment also has objectives associated with your Python workflow:
* Introduce and practice your primary work environment: text editor, IPython console,  and Terminal.
* Introduce and practice Jupyter Notebooks.
* Discuss appropriate use of text editor/IPython/Terminal vs. Jupyter Notebooks.
* Use `git` to back-up changes to your code as you work on the assignment.

Here's the [assignment](assignment.md).
