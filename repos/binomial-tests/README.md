# Binomial Hypothesis Tests

This assignment is all about the Binomial distribution!  In particular, you will construct some tests of null hypothesies that result in binomial distributions, and then calcualte the associated p-values.

## Objectives

- Describe the null hypothesis testing procedure.
- Define a p-value.
- Setup a null hypothesis for a binomial test.
- Calculate a p-vale for a binomial test.
