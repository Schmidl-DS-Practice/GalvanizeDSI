# Sampling Distributions

This assignment will work with the concept of sampling distributions though the lens of the bootstrap.  Our goal will be to use the bootstrap method to create sampling distributions, and derive confidence intervals.

## Objectives

- Define population and sample.
- Use scatterplots, histograms and the empirical CDF to visualize a sample.
- Define what it means for a sample to be independent and identically distributed.
- Define the sampling distribution of a statistic.
- Use bootstrapping to approximate the distribution of a statistic.
- Use bootstrapping to approximate a confidence interval for a population parameter.
