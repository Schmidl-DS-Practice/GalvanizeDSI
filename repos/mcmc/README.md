# Bayesian Statistics using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo

While simple Bayesian Statistics can be done by considering all possible hypotheses, dividing the hyposthesis space into small pieces, or using conjugate priors, more complex problems require a different approach: Markov-chain monte carlo (MCMC). With MCMC, model samples various hypotheses such that the probability of considering a hypothesis is equal to its posterior probability.

Python has several libraries for MCMC, including `pymc`, `PyStan`, and `emcee`. This assignment uses `pymc`.

This is half-day assignment.
