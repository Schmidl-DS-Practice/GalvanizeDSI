'''ols - sum of all (y_true - y_pred)**2
lasso - 
ridge - 
combo of lasso and ridge - '''

#2
'''maximum_squat_weight is correlated to one of the other four features.
how many features are used. n**5 / n**4 as many samples'''

#3
'''step-by-step decision tree- determine which feature is best to be your root.
determine where to split to left and right.
continue to split left and right until you reach leaf nodes. find the error.
binary split - is it or isn't it. greater than or equal to 0.5, for example, is a 1
and less than 0.5 is a 0.
olympic jumper - overfit, reduce layers.'''

#4
'''bootstrap samples of size whole dataset.'''

#5
'''averaging a set reduces variance'''

#6
'''partial dependents plots.score without of bag feature and then with feature.'''

#7
'''smaller in boosted.
gradient boost vs adaboost.
stump vs not stump.
high bias low(high) var in boosted vs low bias high var. averaging all results random forest.'''
