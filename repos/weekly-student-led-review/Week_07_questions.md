### Week 7 Review Questions

1. In processing text to perform analyses, what steps are usually involved? When 
   might you use, or not, some of these steps?

2. The Naive Bayes classification algorithm is often used for text classification.
   Why is that?  Explain how Bayes rule is used to implement to algorithm.  How
   is a classification made?  Why is this method called "Naive" Bayes?

3. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?   
   <br>
4. Provide 3 types of questions you would answer with   
   a) supervised learning:   
   <br>
   b) unsupervised learning:    
   <br>
5. Whiteboard the algorithm (psuedocode) for the KMeans algorithm.  
   <br>
6. Why is using Within-Cluster-Sum-of-Squares (WCSS) not a good metric to detemine 
   how many clusters you should pick in Kmeans clustering?  Name other
   methods/metrics you could use to pick the number of clusters.   
   <br>
7. a) What are principal components?     
   <br>
   b) What are some benefits of Principal Component Analysis?    
   <br>
   c) How are principal components calculated?  
   <br>
8. Compare and contrast Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Non-Negative
   Matrix Factorization (NMF). Which method makes more interpretable topics,
   and why?
   <br>
9. What is the difference between hard and soft clustering?  What algorithms
   did you learn this week that perform hard clustering?  How about soft
   clustering?
