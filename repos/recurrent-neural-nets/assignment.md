# Recurrent neural networks

## Introduction

The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) variant of recurrent neural networks has been deployed in speech recognition products by Google, Apple, and Microsoft.  If you are trying to model a sequence where important context occurs much earlier, there is a good chance you'll want to use an LSTM.

## Basic
### Part 1: Read about LSTM
The first part of this assignment is **not** coding.  It's reading this [excellent blog post](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) by Christopher Olah and answering the following questions.

1) What problem do standard recurrent neural networks have that LSTMs seek to address?

2) Contrast the repeating module in a standard recurrent neural net with that of an LSTM.  

3) In an LSTM module:  
  a) What holds the information?  
  b) What structures add or remove information?  

4) Describe how an LSTM module:   
a) Updates its state.  
b) Determines what to output.

## Advanced
### Part 2: Forecast time-series data
In the `src` folder you'll find an `lstm.py` file and a `run_lstm.py` file.  These files are slightly modified versions of Jakob Aungiers code you can find [here](https://github.com/jaungiers/LSTM-Neural-Network-for-Time-Series-Prediction).  In his [blog](http://www.jakob-aungiers.com/articles/a/LSTM-Neural-Network-for-Time-Series-Prediction) you can read how he used an LSTM to:  
1) Learn a sine wave, and then  
2) Predict the rise and fall of the S&P 500.  
Your assignment is to play with and try to understand this code.  Some things to look out for include:  
* The use of argument parsing.  When you execute the code from them main directory, you tell your code to analyze either the **sine** wave data or the S&P 500 data:
  - `$ python src/run_lstm.py sine`
* How the data is split into train and test sets.
* How the target is determined.  
* How the model architecture is defined.
* The hyperparameters that are needed to get good performance on the sine wave.  
* The hyperparameters required to get good performance on the S&P 500.  

If you have time, find your own times series data set and see if some version of this architecture works for predicting your data.
