Description,"Estimated rate of death from drug poisoning, including both illicit and prescription drugs, per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000. Only available at county level. For state data, see drug deaths per 100,000. Estimates come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Data Visualization Gallery. The data are binned below 30 deaths per 100,000 in bins of size 2, and counties with estimated rates over 30 are coded as "">30"". It should be noted that these data are estimates, and are drawn from a model designed to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size. <strong>Specific county values should be interpreted with caution, and the actual measure of drug deaths per 100,000 should be preferred where available</strong>. More information on the estimation procedure available at the link below."
Technical Notes,"The data are binned, and for ease of presentation were coded as the lower end of the range. Values should be interpreted as a range from the reported value to the next multiple of two. For example, 6.1 should be interpreted as the range '6.1-8'. A value of 30 should be interpreted as '30+'."

Description,"The number of standardized 30-day supplies of opioids reimbursed by Medicare Part D, per Medicare Part D enrollee. A standardized 30-day supply is bottom coded at 1, and top coded at 12. This means efforts to reduce the number of doses per prescription are not well captured by this measure. However, as the state-level data do not contain the actual days' supply, the 30-day supply measure was used for consistency. State data on the number of prescriptions come from the Part D Prescriber Summary table, which detail the number of standardized 30-day supplies of each drug billed to Medicare per state. County data were aggregated from the Part D Prescriber Public Use File (PUF), which contains data at the provider-drug level. Providers were matched to their ZIP code by using their unique National Provider Identifier (NPI) in the July 2015 NPPES Data Dissemination. The July 2015 NPPES Data Dissemination was accessed via <a href='https://archive.org/' target=_blank>archive.org</a>, as it is not currently posted publicly but is available upon request. The standardized 30-day supply measure was also used at the county level, although days' supply, a more accurate measure of the volume prescribed, is available in the Prescriber PUF. Part D enrollment data comes from the <a href='https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/CMSProgramStatistics/Dashboard.html', target=_blank>Medicare Enrollment Dashboard.</a>"
