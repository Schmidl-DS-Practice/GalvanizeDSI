##Build a Linear Regression Model

You are provided with a dataset `data/loansData.csv`. Build a linear regression
model that identifies the key drivers of interest rate for individual loans.
Perform exploratory data analysis of the relationship between the features and
relationship of the features with the response. Select your features and
use `statsmodels` to build a linear regression model.

You do not have to use all the variables. Focus on building the simplest model
that explains interest rate. Justify the features you have or have not included
in your model.
