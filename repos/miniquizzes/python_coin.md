## Miniquiz

**Include your code and answers in** `python_coin.py`.

1. Given an infinite number of US coins (`coins = [1, 5, 10, 25]`) and an amount `value` in cents, what are minimum number of coins needed to make change for `value`? Write a function `find_change` that takes as input the coin denominations `coins`, and `value` as the amount in cents. Your function should return the minimum amount of coins necessary to make change for the specified value as an integer. 

### Example

```python
coins = [1, 5, 10, 25]

In [23]: find_change(coins, 100)
4

In [24]: find_change(coins, 74)
8
```
