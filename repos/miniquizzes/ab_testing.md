##A / B Testing Miniquiz

You are a data scientist at Company X.

One of our product managers recently tested three different versions of our
landing page. When a new person navigated to our site, they were shown one
of the three versions of the page. The PM ran a report that says how many
people

1. Registered a free account on Company X
2. Then went on to buy the product

<br>

The data for the three pages is shown below:


|                | Visitors  | Registrations | Purchases |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Landing Page 1 | 998,832   | 331,912       | 18,255    |
| Landing Page 2 | 1,012,285 | 349,643       | 18,531    |
| Landing Page 3 | 995,750   | 320,432       | 18,585    |


The PM needs your help in figuring out whether the differences between the
groups are meaningful, and most importantly of all, determining which landing
page we should make the new default based on the results. In your response,
please describe and justify the analysis you use, the estimated size of the
differences between groups in terms of registration rate and purchase rate,
and finally, provide the decision you would recommend and why.
