Regularized Regression
===========================================
Regularization is an important technique for controlling overfitting.  

## Objectives
 - Compare and contrast Lasso and Ridge regression
 - Understand the tradeoff the effects on Bias and Variance as we change:
   * Sample Size
   * Number of parameters
 - Know the cost function for both methods
 - Build test error curves for Ridge regression while varying the alpha parameter to determine the optimal level of regularization
