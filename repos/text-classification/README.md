# Text Classification
It turns out that every ML task has some application with text.  For example, [sentiment analysis](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/sentiment.pdf) is simply regression applied to predicting the positive or negative sentiment score associated with a block of text.  As this week progresses, we will see several applications of unsupervised learning associated with natural language data as a way of improving data representation.

This repository focuses on text classification.  Text data has many complications that make working with it a significant challenge.  The assignment has you explore a new classification module: the Naive Bayes classifier.  It's especially useful for text, but has applications in other domains too.
