# Probability Distributions

This assigment will get you practice working with random quantities and their distributions.

In part I you will get some practice identifying which common distribution serves a good model for a given situation, and then using that distribution to calculate the probability of an event of interest.

In part II you will setup and run a simulation to draw samples from a distribution that is a complex combination of other random quantities.

## Lesson Objectives

- Define the concepts of PDF, PMF, and CDF.
- Relate the concepts of PDF and PMF to the CDF
- Use the CDF of a distribution to compute probabilities of events described by the given distribution.
- Define the bernoulli distribution, and give example of situations it describes.
- Define the binomial distribution, and give example of situations it describes.
- Define the poisson distribution, and give example of situations it describes.
- Define the uniform distribution, and give example of situations it describes.
- Define the normal distribution, and give example of situations it describes.
- Define the exponential distribution, and give example of situations it describes.
