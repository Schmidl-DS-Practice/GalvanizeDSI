# Big O Notation

Today we'll be doing a little more in-depth work regarding computational efficiency,
analyzing the efficiency of functions.  We will do so by exploring a common computer science task of building sorters.

## Goals
<ol>
<li>Understand the 'Divide and Conquer' approach analyzing large datasets.</li>
<li>Perform timing analysis for python functions.</li>
<li>Create a Heap, and use it to perform Heapsort</li>
</ol>
