# Welcome to the beautiful world of Pandas.
You can think of pandas as being very similar to Excel, except it is more powerful and flexible, and enables you to work with larger data sets.

Wes McKinney, creator of Pandas, has this to say about why he developed it:

> I had a distinct set of requirements that were not well-addressed by any single tool at my disposal:
 * Data structures with labeled axes supporting automatic or explicit data alignment. This prevents common errors resulting from misaligned data and working with differently-indexed data coming from different sources
 * Integrated time series functionality.
 * The same data structures handle both time series data and non-time series data.
 * Arithmetic operations and reductions (like summing across an axis) that would be able to maintain the metadata (axis labels).
 * Flexible handling of missing data.
 * Merge and other relational operations found in popular database databases(SQL- based, for example).

 > and... I wanted to be able to do all of these things in one place, preferably in a language well- suited to general purpose software development.
