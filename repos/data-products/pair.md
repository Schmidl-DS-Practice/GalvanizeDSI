# Build a web app

For the afternoon, you are going to experiment with flask, templates and bootstrap to build a site.

You can work individually or with someone else. You're welcome to start working on the frond end of your project, or you can just do something fun.

Start with the bootstrap templates and modify them to fit your needs.
