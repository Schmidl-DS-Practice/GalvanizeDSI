Natural Language Processing
===

This exercise continues our journey into Natural Language Processing.  As you may have noticed, text is very different from numbers, which both are very different form images, and users, and.... Moral of the story, every type of data is unique and has its own set of challenges.  We need to encode (quantize) all of these so that we can apply our ML theory to build models and the more effectively we can encode their context/meaning, the more powerful our model will be.  Once quantized (in a matrix) it doesn't matter (as much) what type our data originated as, we can then apply our ML machinery/models transparently.

Today will focus on how to effectively capture the richness of human language in a numeric/matrix form.
