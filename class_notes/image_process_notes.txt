uint8 is an unsigned, 8 bit integer. 2^8 = 256, so uint8 values go from 0 - 255. In a grayscale image, 0 will be black and 255 white. This is the most common format.

uint16 also unsigned, 16 bit. 2^16 = 65536. Twice the memory of a uint8 value.

float a float value (usually 64 bit) between 0-1. 0 black, 1 white.


Dealing With Images:

Numpy - this is a standard way to store and work with the image matrix in python.

scikit-image - included with Anaconda it was developed by the SciPy community. It can be used to do many things we will cover shortly.

OpenCV - there is a Python wrapper of OpenCV which is a C++ library for computer vision. It is a very powerful tool as it has several pretrained models in it and the structure to allow training of your own classical image models.

PIL and Pillow - Pillow is supposed to be a user friendly version of PIL which is the Python Imaging Library. It adds image processing capabilities to Python.
