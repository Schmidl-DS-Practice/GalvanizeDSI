Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.

Unsupervised learning is a type of self-organized ... learning that helps find previously unknown patterns in data set without pre-existing label

parametric algorithm:
                      -has a fixed number of parameters
                      -makes assumptions about the structure of the data
                      -will work well if the assumptions are correct!
                      -common examples: linear regression, neural networks, statistical
                          distributions defined by a finite set of parameters

non-parametric algorithm:
                          -uses a flexible number of parameters, and the number of parameters
                              often grows as it learns from more data.
                          -makes fewer assumptions about the data
                          -common examples: K-Nearest Neighbors, decision trees
                          
one predictor:
                Y = Bo + B1X + e                          
> one predictor:
                Y = BoXo + B1X1 + B2X2 + ... + BpXp + e
                
B = (X**T(.)X)**-1(.)X**T(.)y
(.) = dot product of matrices   

y = B1(.)X where Bo = zero
