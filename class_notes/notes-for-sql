(INNER) JOIN: Discards any entries that do not have
match between the keys specified in the ON clause. No
null/nan values.

LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Keeps all entries in the left (FROM)
table, regardless of whether any matches are found in the
right (JOIN) tables. Some null/nan values.
    
    RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Is the same, except keeps all entries in the
    right (JOIN) table instead of the left (FROM) table); usually avoided
    because it does the same thing as a LEFT join
    
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Keeps the rows in both tables no
matter what. More null/nan values.
