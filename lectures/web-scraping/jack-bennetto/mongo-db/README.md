Mongo DB Lecture
===========================

A lecture on Mongo Database covering the following topics:

### MongoDB

  - Client's vs. Servers.
  - JSON.
  - Using MongoDB to store data.
  - Querying and updating a Mongo Collection.

The content here is split from Matt Drury's lectures on this and Web Scraping, which are a (quite heavily) modified version of Miles Erickson's lecture.  The major changes are:

  - A general re-arrangement of the material.
  - A general filling in of details around bullet points in the original.
  - A new example scraping the leaderboards for Super Metriod from a website.

Key Points for Student Interaction
----------------------------------

There are some exercises built in throughout the lecture building on key concepts.  Some other ideas:

  - Give students the chance to name other examples of a client server architecture.
