Web Scraping Lecture
===========================

A lecture on Web Scraping covering the following topics:

### Web Scraping

  - HTML Structure.
  - Getting hypertext into python with `requests`
  - Loading hypertext as a python object with `BeautifulSoup`.
  - Navigating hypertext with `BeautifulSoup.`
  - Storing data scraped from hypertext.

The content here is split from Matt Drury's lectures on this and Mongo, which are a (quite heavily) modified version of Miles Erickson's lecture.  The major changes from that are:

  - A general re-arrangement of the material.
  - A general filling in of details around bullet points in the original.
  - A new example scraping the leaderboards for Super Metriod from a website.

Key Points for Student Interaction
----------------------------------

There are some exercises built in throughout the lecture building on key concepts.  Some other ideas:

  - Navigate to a webpage with a table, and have students use the developer tools to isolate the hypertext that contains the table.
