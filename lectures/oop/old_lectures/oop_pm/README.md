Extra Day: Sklearn and Object Oriented Programming
==================================================

This is an extra, optional data of the course.  The focus here is on sklearn, and how it uses features of OOP to provide a good user experience.  The objective is not so much to learn more features of sklearn, but to use features of sklearn to get a feeling for good OOP design.

Objectives
----------

  - Understand the fit/predict interface.
  - Understand the fit/transform interface.
  - Use a `Pipeline` to chain together transformers and regressors/classifiers.
  - Use `FeatureUnion` to concatenate multiple new features.
  - Write a `PolynomialExpansion` class to create polynomial features out of a given column.
