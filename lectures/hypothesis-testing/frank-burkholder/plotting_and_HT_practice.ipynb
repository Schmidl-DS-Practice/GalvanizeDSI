    "* Use scipy.stats.norm to make the distribution\n",
    "* Use np.linspace to make your x values (the lunch hours).  \n",
    "* Use the percentile point function (ppf) to ensure that your x values cover 99.9% of the distribution.\n",
    "* Use the .pdf method on the norm object and your x values (lunch hours) to make the pdf of the lunch hours.\n",
    "* Use the object oriented way of making a plot, i.e. `fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1)`, then `ax.plot(...`    \n",
