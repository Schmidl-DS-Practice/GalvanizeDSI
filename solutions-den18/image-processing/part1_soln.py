	4.) The canny filter performs better in terms of edge detection. It can be useful to 
	use an edge detection filter in image classification to help speed up the process of 
	training your model and to potentially help reduce overfitting. Since you are reducing 
	the amount of information fed into the model to train it, it will train faster and potentially
	avoid some part of the overfitting that would have occured if you hadn't performed 
	edge filtering. 

	The canny filter takes much longer on average (0.43 seconds for the sobel and 4.9 for the canny). 
	And to think this was only for four images...

	Using a sigma of 1 or 2 looks like it would work the best. Sigma of 0 picks up too many edges, and 
	3 and 4 don't pick up enough. I'm going to go with a sigma of 1 so that we can still pick up Brad
	Pitts beard. It's a nice beard.
