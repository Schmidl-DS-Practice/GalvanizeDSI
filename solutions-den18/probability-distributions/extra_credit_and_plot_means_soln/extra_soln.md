## Extra Part 1: Covariance and Joint Distribution

1. Read in data

   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv('data/admissions.csv')
   ```

2. Covariance Function

   ```python
   def covariance(x1, x2):
       return np.sum((x1 - np.mean(x1)) * (x2 - np.mean(x2))) / (len(x1) - 1.)

   print covariance(df.family_income, df.gpa)
   print covariance(df.family_income, df.parent_avg_age)
   print covariance(df.gpa, df.parent_avg_age)

   #Check your results
   df.cov()
   ```

3. Normalizing covariance to compute correlation

   ```python
   def correlation(x1, x2):
       std_prod = np.std(x1) * np.std(x2)
       covar = covariance(x1, x2)
       return covar / std_prod

   print correlation(df.family_income, df.gpa)
   print correlation(df.family_income, df.parent_avg_age)
   print correlation(df.gpa, df.parent_avg_age)

   #Check your results
   df.corr()
   ```

4. Computing the GPA threshold for each income class

   ```python
   # Categorize the family income
   def income_category(income):
       if income <= 26832:
           return 'low'
       elif income <= 37510:
           return 'medium'
       else:
           return 'high'
   # Apply the categorization and define a new column
   df['family_income_cat'] = df.family_income.apply(income_category)

   # Alternatively, we can use pandas' cut function to bin the data
   max_income = df['family_income'].max()
   df['family_income_cat']=pd.cut(np.array(df['family_income']), [0,26382,37510,max_income],
                                         labels=["low","medium","high"])
   ```

   ```python
   # Get the conditional distribution of GPA given an income class
   low_income_gpa = df[df['family_income_cat'] == 'low'].gpa
   medium_income_gpa = df[df['family_income_cat'] == 'medium'].gpa
   high_income_gpa = df[df['family_income_cat'] == 'high'].gpa

   # Plot the distributions
   from scipy.stats.kde import gaussian_kde
   def plot_smooth(gpa_samp, label):
       my_pdf = gaussian_kde(gpa_samp)
       x = np.linspace(min(gpa_samp) , max(gpa_samp))
       plt.plot(x, my_pdf(x), label=label)

   fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
   plot_smooth(low_income_gpa, 'low income')
   plot_smooth(medium_income_gpa, 'medium income')
   plot_smooth(high_income_gpa, 'high income')
   plt.xlabel('GPA', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
   plt.ylabel('Probability Density', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
   plt.legend()
   ```

5. 90th percentile GPA for each income class

   ```python
   # The 90th percentile GPA for each class
   print '90th percentile GPA for low income class', np.percentile(low_income_gpa, 90)
   print '90th percentile GPA for medium income class', np.percentile(medium_income_gpa, 90)
   print '90th percentile GPA for high income class', np.percentile(high_income_gpa, 90)
   ```

## Extra Part 2: Pearson Correlation vs Spearman Correlation

1. Load in the new data

   ```python
   df2 = pd.read_csv('data/admissions_with_study_hrs_and_sports.csv')
   ```

2. Make a scatter plot of GPA against Hours Studied

   ```python
   plt.scatter(df2['gpa'], df2['hrs_studied'], alpha=.01, edgecolor='none')
   slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = sc.linregress(df2['gpa'], df2['hrs_studied'])
   plt.plot(df2['gpa'], slope * df2['gpa'] + intercept, color='r', alpha=.4)
   plt.xlabel('GPA', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
   plt.ylabel('Hours Studied', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
   ```

   ![image](imgs/scatter_hr_gpa.png)

3. Correlation between `gpa` and `hrs_studied`

   ```python
   print sc.pearsonr(df2['gpa'], df2['hrs_studied'])
   print sc.spearmanr(df2['gpa'], df2['hrs_studied'])
   # The spearman correlation shows a more positive coefficient since it captures the non-linear relationship
   ```

4. Correlation between `gpa` and `hrs_studied`

   ```python
   print sc.pearsonr(df2['gpa'], df2['sport_performance'])
   print sc.spearmanr(df2['gpa'], df2['sport_performance'])
   # There is s strong relationship between gpa and sports perf. , but the values of the
   # two variables are not monotonically increasing together. Therefore, the coefficients are low
   ```
## Extra Part 3: Assorted

### Set

1. Out of the students in a class, 60% are geniuses, 70% love chocolate,
   and 40% fall into both categories. Determine the probability that a
   randomly selected student is neither a genius nor a chocolate lover.

   ```
   Draw a Venn diagram

    - Probability of both Genius and Chocolate lover is 40%
    - Probability of Genius but not Chocolate lover is 20%
    - Probability of Chocolate lover and not Genius is 30%.

   100% - (40% + 20% + 30%) = 10%
   ```
### Combinatorics

1. A fair 6-sided die is rolled three times, independently. Which is more likely: a
   sum of 11 or a sum of 12?

   ```
   There are 216 possibilities.  We simply enumerate and count.

    * Sum of 11:
      * (1,4,6), (1,5,5) | (2,3,6), (2,4,5) |  (3,3,5), (3,4,4);
      * 6 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 27

    * Sum of 12:
      * (1,5,6) | (2,4,6), (2,5,5) | (3,3,6), (3,4,5) | (4,4,4)
      * 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 1 = 25

    ==> So it is more likely to roll an 11.
    ```


2. 90 students are to be split at random into 3 classes of equal size. Joe and Jane are
   two of the students. What is the probability that they end up in the same
   class?

   ```
   There a few approaches, all equal to 0.3258
    * Approach 1:
       (Think given the class of jane, probability joe is in same class) = 29/89

    * Approach 2:
       88_choose_28 / 89_choose_29

    * Approach 3:
       3 x P(both in class i) = 3 * 88_choose_28 / 90_choose_30
   ```

3. A well-shuffled 52-card deck is dealt to 4 players. Find the probability that
   each of the players gets an ace.

   ```
   (Assume ordering, factor by num. permutations)

    4! * (48_choose_12 x 36_choose_12 x 24_choose_12 /
    (52_choose_13  x  39_choose_13 x 26_choose_13)
   ```

### Random Variable


1. A six-sided die is loaded in a way that each even face is twice as likely as
   each odd face. All even faces are equally likely, as are all odd faces.

   Construct a probabilistic model for a single roll of this die and find the
   probability that the outcome is less than 4.

   ```
   # Set up a probability mass function (PMF) and compute probability

   Sample Space = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

   P(1) = P(3) = P(5) = k
   P(2)= P(4) = P(6) = 2k

   3k + 6k = 1
   k = 1/9

   P(X < 4)
   = P(1) + P(2) + P(3)
   = 1/9 + 2/9 + 1/9
   = 4/9
   ```

2. `X` is a random variable with PMF `p(k) = k^2/a` if `k = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3`
   and `p(k) = 0` otherwise.

  (a) Find `a` and `E[X]`

  (b) Find the expectation value of the random variable `Z = (X - E[X])^2)`

  (c) Using the result from (b), find the variance of `X`

  ```
  (a) Find `a` and `E[X]`
  (b) Find the PMF of the random variable `Z = (X - E[X])^2)`

      First, notice that E(X) = 0 by symmetry

      Let Z = X^2

      P(Z = 1)
      = P(X = -1) + P(X = 1) = 2/a

      P(Z = 4)
      = P(X = -2) + P(X = 2) = 8/a

      P(Z = 9)
      = P(X = -3) + P(X = 3) = 18/a

      28/a = 1
      a = 28

  (c) Find the variance of `X` (use the result from above)

      Var(X)
      = E[X^2] - E(X)^2
      = E(Z)
      = (2/28) * 1 + (8/28) * 4 + (18/28) * 9
      = 7
  ```


3. A soccer team has 2 games scheduled for one weekend. It has a 0.4 probability
   of not losing first game and 0.7 probability of not losing the second
   game, independent of the first. If the team wins a particular game, the
   team is equally likely to win or tie. The team will receive 2 points for a win,
   1 for a tie, and 0 for a loss.
  (a) Find the PMF of the number of points that the team earns over the
   weekend.
  (b) Find the expected value for the number of points earned.
  (c) Find the variance for the number of points earned.

  ```
   * a. Find the PMF of the number of points that the team earns over the weekend.

    P(lose first) = 0.6 --> P(tie first)=P(win first)=0.2
    P(lose second) = 0.3 --> P(tie second)=P(win second)=0.35

    P(X=0) = 0.18
    P(X=1) = 0.27
    P(X=2) = 0.34 = P(LW or TT or WL) = 0.6 x 0.35 + 0.2 x 0.35 + 0.2 x 0.3
    P(X=3) = 0.14
    P(X=4) = 0.07

  * b. Find the expected value for the number of points earned.
    E(X) = 0.18 x 0 + 0.27 x 1 + ... + 0.07 x 4 = 1.65

  * c. Find the variance for the number of points earned.
    E(X^2) = 0.18 x 0 + 0.27 x 1 + ... + 0.07 x 16 = 4.01
    V(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2 = 4.01-1.65^2 = 1.2875
  ```


4. You have 5 keys, one of which is the correct one for the house. Find the PMF
   of the number of trials you will need to open the door, assuming that after
   you try a key that doesn't work you set it aside and you otherwise randomly
   select a key to try next.

   ```
   * P(1) = 1/5
   * P(2) = (4/5) * (1/4) = 1/5
   * P(3) = (4/5) * (3/4) * (1/3) = 1/5
   * P(4) = 1/5
   * P(5) = 1/5

   Another approach, logical reasoning:
   Imagine 5 slots [---]  [---]  [---]  [---]  [---]
   Equal chance in any of those slots.  If check one after another,
   chance it will take exactly 1 time, 2 times, 3 times, 4 times, 5 times are 1/5 each.
   ```

5. You toss independently a fair coin and you count the number of tosses until
   the first tail appears. If this number is `n`, you receive `2^n` dollars.
   What is the expected amount you will receive? How much would you be willing
   to play this game?

   ```
   Let X = # tosses until first tail.
   X ~ Geom(0.5), P(X = k) = 1/2^k, for all k = 1, 2, 3, ...
   W = winnings. P(W = 2^n) = 1/2^n for all n = 1, 2, 3, ...
   E(W) = sum [(2^n) P(W = 2^n)] = infinity
   In reality, no one has an infinite amount of money to play the game forever.
   ```


### Joint Distributions


1. A class of `n` students takes a test consisting of `m` questions. Suppose that
   student `i` submitted answers to the first `m_i,` for `m_i <= m` questions.
  - The grader randomly picks one answer, call it `(I, J)` where `I` is the student
    ID number (values `1,...,n`) and `J` is the question number (values `1,...,m`).
    Assume that all answers are equally likely to be picked. Calculate the joint
    and marginal PMFs of `I` and `J`.
  - Assume that an answer to question `j` if submitted by student `i` is correct
    with probability `p_ij`. Each answer gets `a` points if it is correct and `b`
    points otherwise. Find the expected value of the score of student `i`.

  ```
  * The grader randomly picks one answer,
    call it (I, J) where I is the student ID number (values 1,...,n)
    and J is the question number (values 1,...,m).

  Assume that all answers are equally likely to be picked.
  Calculate the joint and marginal PMFs of I and J.

  P(I=i) = m_i/sum(m_j over all j)
  (Simply number of questions answered by student i over total number of questions answered)

  P(J=j) = sum(Indicator(m_i>=j))/sum(m_j over all j)
  (Probability of selecting a particular question is the total number
   of students who answered at least that many questions,
   divided by total number of questions answered.)

  P(I=i, J=j) = 1/sum(m_j over all j)

  * Assume that an answer to question j if submitted by student i is correct
    with probability p.ij. Each answer gets a points if it is correct and b
    points otherwise. Find the expected value of the score of student i.

    E(score for student i) = sum( a x p_ij + b x (1-p_ij) over all j)
  ```


### Independence

1. Alice and Bob want to choose between the opera and the movies by tossing a
   coin. Unfortunately, the only coin they have is biased, though the bias is
   not known exactly. How can they use the biased coin to make a decision so
   that either option (opera or movies) is equally likely to be chosen?

   ```
   (symmetry)

   Flip the coin in pairs.  If HT comes up first, go to opera.
   If TH comes up first, go to movies.

   Experiment might look like HH, TT, HH, HH, HH HH, HT --> opera
   ```

2. A system consists of `n` identical components, each of which is operational
   with probability `p`, independent of other components. The system is
   operational if at least `k` out of the `n` components are operational. What is
   the probability that the system is operational?

   ```
   Let X ~ Binomial(n,p)

   Then simply plug in P(X >= k) = P(k)+P(k+1)+...+P(n)
   ```

### Covariance and Correlation

1. Suppose that *X* and *Y* are random variables with the same variance. Show
   that *X - Y* and *X + Y* are uncorrelated.

   ```
   cov(X-Y,X+Y) = E[ ((X-Y) - E(X-Y)) ((X+Y) - E(X+Y)) ]

   cov(X-Y, X+Y) = 0

   Correlation is just covariance scaled, so X-Y and X+Y are uncorrelated
   ```
