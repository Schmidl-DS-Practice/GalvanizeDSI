2. Sample mean

   While it may seem strange to take the average of coin flips, when the flip outcomes
   (heads or tails) are encoded as 1's and 0's, respectively, it is of course perfectly
   legitimate to take the average of coin flipping outcomes.  Further, this has the 
   particularly useful benefit that it captures the proportion of flips that are heads 
   (encoded as 1's). Since 1's and 0's are just numbers like any other, we simply take 
   the mean of these numbers just as we would any other set of numbers. I.e., here:

  ((1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0) / 5) = 0.6


3. Probability of data given fair coin

   # Solving the "S = {1,1,0,1,0}" problem:

   The probability of this sequence of head flips (assuming a fair coin)
   is the same as *any other* sequence of head flips, i.e., (0.5)^5.

   # Solving the "3 heads" problem:

   The probability of seeing 3 heads in 5 flips (assuming a fair coin), 
   (as opposed to the sequence "S = {1,1,0,1,0}"), i.e., 
   Pr(3 heads in 5 flips), is determined by a binomial probability model with
   n = 5 and p = 0.5. This model gives us the following formula for the probability:

   5c3 * 0.5^3 * 0.5^2 = 0.3125

   5c3 is five choose three and it is equal to 5!/(3!*2!).  It is the number of ways
   we could get 3 heads on five flips. E.g., HHHTT or HTHTH, etc. And of course, the 
   probability of a head or a tail on any given flip is the same at 0.5, which shows 
   how the binomial probability distribution probabilities are produced.

4. P(x=T | y=b)

  Since y=b, we need the relative probability that x=T within column "b", i.e., 
  
  (0.1) / (0.1 + 0.15) = 0.4
