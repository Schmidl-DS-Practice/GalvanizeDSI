Please answer the questions below.  Each is worth 3 pts.

Question 1: Git
---------------
1a)  What is git, and why do software developers use it? (1 pt)

Git is a version control software. Developers use it to keep track of changes
in their code, work simultaneously with others on large projects, and test
changes in code on branches before implementing (merging) them with their main branch,
often called 'master.'

1b) What is the 'staging area', or 'index' in git? (1 pt)
The staging area lets developers add the changes they've made to code before fully
'committing' the code, or adding it to the tracked changes in git.

1c) What does the command 'git commit' do? (1 pt)
"git commit -m 'your commit message'" will add the files in your staging area 
or index to your tracked changes. It records changes to the repository.

Question 2: Python datatypes
----------------------------
2a) Please give an example of a mutable and immutable datatype. (2 pts)

Mutable: lists.
Immutable: tuples.

2b) What would be displayed when 'b' is printed in the code below. (1 pt)

In[1] a = [1, 'a', [2, 3], 4.5]

In[2] b = a

In[3] a[0] = -0.1

In[4] print(b)
Out [4] [-0.1, 'a', [2, 3], 4.5]
