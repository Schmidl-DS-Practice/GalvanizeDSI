### Probability 
1.
The bias of a coin is 0.6. What is the probability of flipping 
8 or more heads in 10 flips?

``` python 

import scipy.stats as scs

rv = scs.binom(10, 0.6)

rv.pmf(8) + rv.pmf(9) + rv.pmf(10)

0.1672897536 
```

You've found a secret admirer note on your desk, and don't know who it might've 
come from but you know it must've been one of your  three office mates:  Jack, John, or Jimmy.  
As of yesterday, you thought it was twice as likely that Jimmy had a crush on you than John,
and that John and Jack were equally likely to have a crush on you.  
However even if Jimmy liked you, you think there'd only be 5% he'd leave you a note.
On the other hand, if Jack liked you there'd be a whopping 50% chance he'd leave you a note.
and if John liked you, there'd be a 20% chance he'd leave you a note. 

What's the probability that the note came from John?

`J1 = {Jack likes you}, J2 = {John likes you}, J3 = {Jimmy likes you}`

Calculate their probabilities.

`P(J1) = P(J2), P(J3) = 2 * P(J1), P(J1) + P(J2) + P(J3) = 1`

`implies P(J1) = P(J2) = 0.25, P(J3) = 0.50`

`N = {Note is left}`

Find probability of ever getting a note

`P(N|J1) = 0.50, P(N|J2) = 0.20, P(N|J3) = 0.05.`

`P(N) = P(N|J1) * P(J1) + P(N|J2) * P(J2) + P(N|J3) * P(J3)`

     = 0.50 * 0.25 + 0.20 * 0.25 + 0.05 * 0.50
     
     = 0.20

Use Bayes' theorem

`P(J2|N) = P(N|J2) * P(J2) / P(N) `
        `= (0.20 * .25) / 0.20 = 0.25`



### Statistics 

Below are the total number of log-ins for 20 different randomly selected users from 2014:

     logins = [10, 25, 12, 35, 14, 18, 16, 15, 22, 10, 9, 11, 49, 20, 15, 9, 18, 19, 20, 20]

What is the sample mean?
4.
What is the sample variance?

```python 
def calc_mean_var(v):
     return np.mean(v), np.var(v) * len(v) / (len(v) - 1) 
```

`mean = 18.35`
`variance = 91.502631578947359`


5. The website owner would like to know to within 95% confidence an interval that
contains the mean number of log-ins.  WITHOUT ACTUALLY CALCULATING THE CONFIDENCE
INTERVAL, name and briefly explain two techniques you'd use to calculate it.

You could use the central limit theorem to determine the confidence interval around
the mean.  It would require using the sample's mean, variance, and the number
of samples drawn to calculate the standard error of them mean, and that combined
with the desired significance level would allow you to calculate the confidence
interval.

Alternatively, you could use bootstrapping to create a confidence interval.  Here
you'd draw with replacement from the sample creating many bootstrapped versions
of the sample set.  For each bootstrapped sample, calculate the mean.  Use
the distribution of the bootstrapped means to calculate the confidence interval
(rank from from low to high, throw out the bottom 2.5% and top 2.5%).
