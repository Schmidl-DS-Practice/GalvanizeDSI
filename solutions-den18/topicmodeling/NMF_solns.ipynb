    "# Topic Modeling: Finding latent topics in NYT articles with NMF\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise takes an _unsupervised_ approach to mining a corpus. Recall: _Unsupervised_ methods are those which do not use _labeled_ data, but instead attempt to glean information from the observed data only. In this exercise, we'll re-discover a few NYT topics (sections) using only the contents (words) of each article. We will acheive this by using NMF to find latent topics, having the user hand-label each latent topic, then analyzing a few NYT articles to see how well NMF picked up on the underlying article topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've implemented this exercise in two stand-alone modules (`pair.py` and `my_nmf.py`). This notebook will walk you through the high-level steps, using those two modules along the way."

We'll limit the vocabulary to 5000 words so that we only focus on common words; uncommon words might muddle the signal, but feel free to try out other values than 5000 to see how the results are affected."
