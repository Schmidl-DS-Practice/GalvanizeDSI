## Welcome to Galvanize Denver's 18th Data Science Immersive!

This website is your primary resource for class activities. On this page you'll find information you about the program as a whole as well as links to daily readings, assignments, and lectures. Please make a habit of refreshing and checking it every day, and always make sure you're using the branch for this cohort.

**Do not fork or clone this repo.** Details may change, so **please bookmark this page**.

Please review the documents in the 'notes' directory of this repo. 

#  Weekly overview
The Data Science Immersive (DSI) has 8 instructional weeks, 3 capstone weeks, and the final showcase/career week.  There is a one-week break to rest, review and prepare. During this time instructors will have limited availability.

There are six graded 1 hour assessments on Mondays, plus a readiness assessment at the start of the course. Most instructional weeks end with a group case study on Friday. 

The capstone weeks are reserved for your capstone projects (see below).  Besides having most of each day to work on your capstone, you will also scrum with your peers and participate in mock job interiews. For capstones 1 & 2 you'll present your project to your peers and instructors on Friday afternoon. Capstone 3 is the final graduation project that is presented to the data science community at the end of the course.

## Other important links
* [Solutions](https://github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/%solutions%) for assessments, assignments, and the weekly review will be added to this repository.  If a solution is missing, please bug an instructor!
* [Previous student capstone projects](https://github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/project-proposals/blob/master/past_student_projects.md)  Whether you're looking for capstone ideas or resources to help you with your current capstone, take a look here.  Some of the most exemplary/helpful ones are marked with an asterisk.
* [Lectures](https://github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/lectures/tree/%campus%) **Clone this Github repository locally.** Lectures for each day can be found in the lectures repo of the same name.  Checkout the %campus% branch.
* [Quick reference](./quick-reference) We've curated online material to provide you "cheatsheets" for important topics in the DSI.  All the guides have been combined into `DSI_quick_ref.pdf` in the `quick-reference` folder, but each of the files is also available individually.  For instance, the `Git.pdf` is likely to come in handy everyday.  The `DSI_Installation_Guide.pdf` is also in this folder if at some point you need to re-install VSCode and Anaconda's distribution of Python.
 
## Capstone Projects
Capstone projects allow you to practice your new datascience skills on projects of your choosing.  They contribute to your Github portfolio and give you specific skills to talk about during job interviews. You will submit capstone proposals to the instructors for approval before the capstone weeks begin. Very often capstone 3 builds on work done on capstone 2, and sometimes even capstone 1.

## Daily Outline
In the weekly tables below, each row represents a day.  
Each row contains information and links:
* __Day__ Day of the Week
* __Readings__ Readings for the day (to be completed the night before).
* __Repos__ The day's exercise(s). 
* __Lectures__ The day's lecture notes and slides

Most Instructional days will follow the same general schedule:

* Assessments, Career-Services Activities, Guest Speakers
* Morning Lecture (~1.5 Hours)
* Morning Lab
* Lunch
* Afternoon Lecture (~1.5 Hours)
* Afternoon Lab 
* End-of-Day Assignment Review and Stand-Down

## Textbooks
We will focus on a few canonical texts for the class and readings will be assigned from them. If they are not in a physical form in our library, they are located in digital form on the Time Capsule or the Internet.
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf): The book we use for the majority of machine learning readings.
* [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf): If ISLR doesn't have enough detail for you, then look in ESL by the same authors.
* [Machine Learning In Action](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1cm3fV8cnJwcUNWWnFaRWgwTDA/view?usp=sharing)
* [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) Intended as a deep learning text, its introductory treatment of probability, linear algebra, and mathematics is excellent.
* [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp2/) We introduce forecasing, but it's a specialized discipline.  This free text expands on the subject.

### Supplementary
* [Doing Data Science](http://www.amazon.com/Doing-Data-Science-Straight-Frontline/dp/1449358659): One of the best treatments of the field with plenty of case studies.
* [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do): Some of the `pandas` methods have changed (always reference `pandas` [online documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/)) but a solid book on data analysis in Python.
* [Practical Data Science with R](http://www.manning.com/zumel/): through we will not use R, this is a stellar book and we will use it for its content/theory

## Video Series
* [Youtube lectures by Hastie and Tibshirani on Statistical Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9V07EIfIg&list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D_qZ5V)
* [StatsQuest](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer) - A goofy but clear explanation of statistics and machine learning concepts.
* [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) Self-described as combination math & entertainment, this website has explanations for many machine learning topics.
